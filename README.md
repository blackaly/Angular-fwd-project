# My Store
A minimum store project that give the user the ability to shopping online.

# Build Status
There is a bug in the product list component where the inputs blank, and when I initalize the array, the whole list drops.

## The project structure:
- First we divided the project into three component:
    - The cart component when the user need to add something he is interested about in the cart to save it to later. 
    - The product list component, that component is resposible for displaying all the product that store has. 
    - The product details component, that component is responsible for display detailed information of a product. 
    - The complete-order component is responsible for ensure that order is done and is shipping. 
    - The user-form component is responsible for giving an basic info from the user.
